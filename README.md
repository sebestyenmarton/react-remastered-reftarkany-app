## About

<h3> :speech_balloon: :sunglasses: 
This is my first published website which i made a long time ago, but i am now refactoring into a more professional version. </h3> <h4><b>          
     -This project was supported by the Reformed Church :dove: in Köröstárkány.<br>       
     -I am constantly developing and updating the website (that's why it's not necessarily up to date the live version.)<br>       
     -Can be found on the live version of the following link: :globe_with_meridians: http://www.reftarkany.hu/ <br>
